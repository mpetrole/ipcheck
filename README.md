IPCheck

Gets and sorts IPs for given domains. Put the domains/URIs in the input.txt, and
run ipcheck.rb, then receive output in output.txt. It will strip out the domains from URIs,
so it is not necessary to put only domains. It will also ignore blank lines and extra text AFTER the url.

Requires at least Ruby 2.x

Need Ruby? Linux - it's probably available as a package in your package manager. Windows - use this https://rubyinstaller.org/.
Mac - I recommend RVM https://rvm.io/rvm/install
